Build to Wear – Website Structure & Design Plan (Optimized for GitHub Pages)

🌐 General Setup

Platform: GitHub Pages
Design Goals: Clean, minimal, poetic, and highly usable. Should reflect intentional UI/UX design and elegant simplicity. Mobile-first, interactive, and fast-loading.

Fonts:
Headings: DM Serif Display (Google Fonts)
Body: Inter (Google Fonts)

Color Palette:
Dark Base: Ink Black #1A1A1A
Light Base: Paper White #F7F7F5
Accent: Deep Coral #E95454 (a slightly darker, richer tone than #FF6B6B)

Global Components:
Navbar:
Logo: logo.svg
Site Title: Build to Wear
Navigation Links: Home | 10 Founders
Sticky on scroll, subtle shadow

Footer (on all pages):
Simple, monochrome
Include copyright, email/contact, and social

Interactivity:
Smooth scroll transitions
Scroll-based section animations
Button hover states (e.g. color shift or underline)
Lazy-loading images
Responsive across devices

🏠 Homepage (index.html)
1. Hero Section
Fullscreen layout
Centered serif headline:
10 Creators. 10 Stories. One Hoodie at a Time.
We turn your creative journey into something you can wear.
CTA Button: Apply for Founders Drop (scrolls or links to Founders page)

2. Idea / Short Pitch Section
2-column layout (text left, image right)
Image: folded_hoodie.png
Text: Short, poetic pitch (e.g., “Not merch. Not branding. A story you can wear.”)

3. Mission Statement Section
Light background, serif heading
We believe every creator deserves to be seen — not as a logo, but as a process.

4. Problem–Solution Section
Split layout with alternating content or visually styled columns
Headings:
Problem: Portfolios are flat. Resumes are cold. Merch is shallow.
Solution: A hoodie that speaks. A blog that documents. A story that stays.

5. CTA / Call-to-Join Section

6. Newsletter Signup
Embedded form via Buttondown:

<iframe
scrolling="no"
style="width:100%!important;height:220px;border:1px #ccc solid !important"
src="https://buttondown.com/dumitrescu?as_embed=true"
></iframe><br /><br />

Place after final CTA or before footer
Include a short description:
Get quiet updates from Build to Wear — behind-the-scenes, future drops, and creator stories.

6. Footer
Same across all pages
Includes:
Contact info or email (if desired)
Social icons linking to:
Instagram: @buildtowear
LinkedIn: Build to Wear on LinkedIn
Simple copyright

🔧 Founders Page (founders.html)
1. Hero Section
Become one of the 10 Founders of Build to Wear.
Turn your work into something others can see — and feel.

2. What You Get Section
Clean 3-column or stacked layout with icons or illustrations:
🧵 A custom hoodie designed around your work
📓 A blog-style story feature about you
🔗 A QR code that links to your portfolio

3. Application Form Embed

4. Invite a Friend Feature
Add a button labeled Invite a Friend
On click, this will:
Copy a short pitch and application link to clipboard:
"Hey! Check this out — Build to Wear is creating custom hoodies based on people's work. They're picking 10 creators right now. You should apply! → [insert your link]"
Show a small toast notification like: "Copied! Now share it anywhere."
Optionally ask: "Open WhatsApp / Messages / Twitter?" with buttons to those apps
Implement with simple JavaScript clipboard API and modal/toast animation

4. Footer
Identical to homepage footer

🧠 Development Recommendations
🔤 Language + Framework Setup
To keep things sustainable, simple, and easy to manage on GitHub Pages, use the following:

Frontend Stack:
HTML5 – Semantic and accessible
CSS3 (with variables) – Clean, theme-able styling system
JavaScript (Vanilla) – For clipboard, animations, modal popups, toast notifications

Optional Libraries:
AOS.js – Lightweight scroll animations
GSAP – Smooth micro-interactions (if needed)

Font Integration:
DM Serif Display and Inter via Google Fonts CDN

Icons:
Use inline SVGs or Heroicons for scalable, branded UI

Mobile Responsiveness:
Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
clamp() and min() for responsive font sizes
Media queries for breakpoints

Folder Structure:
/build-to-wear/
├── index.html
├── founders.html
├── /assets/
│   ├── /img/
│   │   └── folded_hoodie.png
│   ├── /fonts/
│   └── /icons/
├── /css/
│   └── style.css
├── /js/
│   └── main.js
├── README.md

Accessibility:
Use proper heading structure (h1, h2, h3...)
Add aria-labels to buttons and icons
Make everything keyboard-accessible

SEO Essentials:
Add <meta name="description">, OpenGraph tags, favicon
Page titles unique per page

Extras to Add:
Dark Mode toggle (CSS variables + JS toggle)
Modal confirmation after email subscription
Smooth scroll + hover animations on buttons and CTAs

🧵 404 Page (404.html)
Purpose:
A poetic, on-brand error page that fits the voice and vibe of Build to Wear.
Headline:
This page doesn’t exist yet — just like the hoodie you're about to build.
Clean serif type
Optional button to return to homepage
Soft animation or fading hoodie icon (optional)

🖼️ Meta Tags + Social Sharing
Add the following to the <head> of every HTML page:

<meta property="og:title" content="Build to Wear">
<meta property="og:description" content="Turn your process into something wearable. 10 creators. 10 stories.">
<meta property="og:image" content="/assets/img/folded_hoodie.png">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<link rel="icon" href="/assets/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="icon" href="/assets/logo.svg" type="image/svg+xml">

Ensure these tags are dynamic if needed later (using JS or separate HTML templates)

🛍️ Order Page (order.html)
Purpose:
A standalone purchase page offering tiered hoodie packages — not linked yet to the homepage or founders page. This page will follow the same visual and UI/UX branding.

1. Hero Section
Want to wear your work?
Choose a package and we’ll build your story into a hoodie.
CTA: Choose Your Package

2. Packages Section (3 Tiers)
Styled as elegant cards or stacked panels, matching brand fonts/colors

🧵 Tier 1 – Essentials
Custom hoodie with minimal visual personalization (QR code + name or quote)
PDF layout preview
Price: e.g., $35 + shipping

✍️ Tier 2 – Signature
Hoodie with curated visuals + quote + link + 1 image
Blog-style feature on the site
Scannable QR code

🔥 Tier 3 – Founder's Edition
Fully custom hoodie design
Dedicated story page
Bonus sticker pack + zine-style PDF
Optional voice quote on QR scan

3. How It Works Section
Step-by-step visual (1. Choose Tier → 2. Submit Info → 3. Hoodie Ships)
Add iconography or soft grid layout

4. Order Form Section
Basic embedded form (Google Form / Tally) to capture:
Name, Email, Shipping address, Tier selection, Hoodie size + color, Portfolio or content to include

5. Footer
Same as the homepage + founders page footer

📈 Analytics
Option 2: Google Analytics (if you need more detailed tracking)
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-78T2M8QE85"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-78T2M8QE85');
</script>

✅ Thank You Page / Confirmation Modal
Option 1: `/thanks.html` (Static Page)
Redirect form submissions to a simple static page

Option 2: Modal Popup (On-Site Feedback)
After form submission, show a soft animated modal (with fade-in)

✅ Strategic Additions to Consider
4. GitHub Deployment Automation
Set up GitHub Actions that trigger deploy on push to main

5. Sitemap + robots.txt
Create sitemap.xml and robots.txt to enable indexing
